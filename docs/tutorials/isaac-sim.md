# Tutorial: Run NVIDIA Isaac Sim with Pixi

NVIDIA Isaac Sim is a crucial tool in the robotics industry, widely used by laboratories and companies for running complex simulations. Pixi, as an efficient package manager, offers an excellent solution for managing the dependencies associated with Isaac Sim and related robotics projects. By combining Pixi with Isaac Sim, we aim to:

1. Simplify the setup process.
2. Enhance reproducibility across different environments.
3. Streamline dependency management.
4. Improve workflow efficiency for robotics developers and researchers.

This tutorial will demonstrate the power and flexibility of using Pixi in conjunction with Isaac Sim, showcasing a practical application in the robotics field.This tutorial guides you through setting up NVIDIA Isaac Sim and ROS2 using Pixi, a powerful package manager for robotics applications.
Follow the steps sequentially to ensure a smooth setup process.
